# Programming

## [Double Decker Couch](https://github.com/EnnuiOcclusion/doubleDeckerCouch)

A video playback web app which allows for synced playback over the internet. Originally built as a vanilla JS and Node full-stack application it was rebuilt entirely in typescript with AngularCLI and a custom configuration for Typescript to NodeJS transpiling.

The Node server acts to negotiate peers and deliver video content. Peer-to-peer data channels and video chat achieved with WebRTC. Experimental peer-to-peer content delivery was explored using WebTorrent.

Overall a fun exploration of cutting-edge web technologies as a means to watch [The Room](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0368226/) with friends across the country.
