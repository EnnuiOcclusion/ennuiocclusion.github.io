This is the personal website of Peter Morris.

This is where I maintain my portfolio, project index, and blog.

I am very interested in creative technology which tells stories in inventive new ways while also paying strict attention to traditional crafts and qualities which have been developed. I believe that programming is both a craft and a community; an ongoing conversation about how we can best solve our problems. I love lisp and would be very happy to never leave Emacs while working all day.

The site itself is hosted on GitHub pages as a Jekyll project. It began using the [Mediator](https://github.com/dirkfabisch/mediator) theme. Following the blog you can see how customization has taken place to build the site almost entirely out of Emacs using Org-Mode.
